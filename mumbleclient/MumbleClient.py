    """
    An object representing a mumble client which uses twisted as an event and network handler.
    This should be inherited and methods overridden or implemented to create specific clients.

    Client life-cycle:

        - Client will connect to TCP control protocol on the specified host and port.
          .controlConnected is a twisted Deferred that will make a callback when this occurs
        - After a sucessfull connection, client will try to send three control messages
          :meth:`versionMessage`, :meth:`authenticationMessage` and
          :meth:`codecVersionMessage` are called in order and the results sent.
          To alter the contents of these messages (assuming no setting exists), it
          is probably easiest to override the function, call the parent to get the
          "base" message, and alter what you wish
        - The server should then send channel and user information
        - The server will then send a ServerSync message. This triggers the
          .clientConnected callback, and the :meth:`ServerSyncReceived`
          method is called.  At this time the .sessionID variable is set
        - Every 5 seconds, the :meth:`pingMessage`: method is called, and
          the message returned sent to the server
        - When the client disconnects, the .clientDisconnected Deferred is
          triggered (probably via errback and not callback) and the
          :meth:`connectionLost` method called.

    In general, the client is informed of activity via method calls. Outside the object, the program is
    informed of (some) activity via the 3 Deferred objects, with more details functionality being the
    responsiblility of the implementer

    In general, if a message Foo is received by the client, the method FooReceived(self,message) will be called.
    See MumbleControlProtocol for a list of MessageTypes.  Some are implemented in this class and can be
    overridden; some are not needed for base functionality but will be called if defined.  The exception is
    the UDPTunnel message, which is one of two possible ways voice data can be received.  In these cases
    the :meth:`VoiceMessageRecieved` function is called whether the voice source was UDP or TCP.

    To tell if a message affects you, compare the message's session (target) or, optionally, actor (source)
    to self.sessionID.  Note that you cannot react to events (cannot send arbitrary messages) until
    just before :meth:`ServerSyncReceived` has been called, which sets sessionID.

    (Note that UDP is not currently supported)
